Performing a Software Update on the Device

1. Enter the command line on the pi device. The granusoft box interface can be exited on the main screen by selecting "Exit", then "Exit" again.
2. Plug in a USB keyboard. (SSH can also be used, but a keyboard is easier and this guide will assume you are using a keyboard.)
3. Connect the device to internet. This can usually be done by running "sudo raspi-config" and using the menu that provides. If more instructions
   are needed, refer to: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md
   You can also use an ethernet cable instead of a wireless connection. 
4. Ensure you are in the FIELDAQ file directory. The command line will list your current directory. It should say "~/FIELDAQ/Granusoft/src". 
   If you just exited the granusoft software then you should already be in the correct directory. 
   If you are not in the correct directory, type "cd ~/FIELDAQ/Granusoft/src".
5. Type "git pull" into the command line. This will download the latest update onto your device. 
6. The device is now updated! You can enter the updated software by either turning the device off and on again or running the command "python3 main.py".
